1- Food_code was used as a row key, 2 column families for food name and calories.

2- I used two column families,  'Display_Name' and 'Calories'. i used these two because
they're the most appropriate to query about, what's the food and how many calories 
it has

create 'foods', 'Display_Name', 'Calories' //
put 'foods', '13110100', 'Display_Name:Ice cream, regular', 'Calories:267.33000'
put 'foods', '12350000', 'Display_Name:Sour creem Dip', 'Calories:133.65000'
